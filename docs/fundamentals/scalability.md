# Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system.

## Types of Scalability

### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single machine
- Pros: Simpler to implement, no need for distributed systems
- Cons: Limited by hardware capabilities, single point of failure

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Adding more machines to the system
- Pros: No theoretical limit, better fault tolerance
- Cons: More complex to implement, requires distributed systems knowledge

## Scalability Patterns

### Load Balancing
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
- Types: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash
- Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB

### Caching
- Stores frequently accessed data in fast memory
- Types: Application Cache, Distributed Cache, CDN
- Tools: Redis, Memcached, Varnish

### Database Scaling
- Read Replicas: Multiple copies for read operations
- Sharding: Splitting data across multiple databases
- Partitioning: Dividing tables into smaller, manageable pieces

## Best Practices

1. **Design for Scale**
   - Use stateless services
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Choose appropriate database scaling techniques

2. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Track system performance
   - Set up alerts for capacity planning
   - Monitor resource utilization

3. **Testing for Scale**
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Performance testing

## Common Challenges

- Data consistency
- Network latency
- Cost management
- Complexity in distributed systems
