# Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time.

## Key Concepts

### Fault Tolerance
- System's ability to continue operating properly in the event of failure
- Redundancy: Having backup components
- Failover: Automatic switching to backup systems

### High Availability
- System's ability to remain operational for a long period of time
- Measured as a percentage of uptime
- Common targets: 99.9% (Three nines) to 99.999% (Five nines)

### Disaster Recovery
- Process of restoring systems after a catastrophic failure
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

## Reliability Patterns

### Redundancy
- Active-Active: All systems are running simultaneously
- Active-Passive: Backup systems are on standby
- Geographic Redundancy: Systems in different locations

### Health Checks
- Regular monitoring of system components
- Automated recovery procedures
- Alerting systems for failures

### Data Backup
- Regular backups
- Multiple backup locations
- Backup verification

## Best Practices

1. **Design for Failure**
   - Assume everything will fail
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Use circuit breakers

2. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Automated alerts
   - Incident response procedures

3. **Testing**
   - Chaos testing
   - Failure injection
   - Recovery testing

## Common Challenges

- Cost of redundancy
- Complexity in distributed systems
- Balancing reliability with performance
- Managing technical debt
